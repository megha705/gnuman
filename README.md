# Gnuman - Satirical Pacman Clone with Map Editor using JavaFX 8.

As our 3rd semester project we had to make a game, I choose to create a Pacman clone. I have no prior experience with game development and never created a GUI application before so the implementation might be a bit messy.

The large.gnuman is a 125x125 cell map, if you want to test this map I recommend turning the dynamic camera on, otherwise the map is too large to display properly.

# Description

You are maneuvering Richard Stallman through the labyrinth that is the development of free software, dodging all these mega corporations trying to prevent you from releasing an alternative to their products.

This game is a satire and should be taken with a grain of salt in case you're a die hard capitalist or the type that gets all offended when a cooperation is not always represented as the marketing team would want it to.

While I do agree with lots of RMSs standpoints it should be noted that I'm neither making a political statement with this game nor am I here to fully represent his view of the world nor am I insulting him.

I tried to emulate Pacman as good as I could. I hope you can enjoy this game =)

# Requirements

For this version you'll need the Java 8 runtime. The OpenJDK 8 might work but I'm not sure since JavaFX is required. There is also a Java 11 version that seems to work well under Win and most Linux systems. The Java 11 version is much larger as it is packed with all the native libraries to guarantee cross platform compatibility. It works with OpenJDK 11 and JavaSE 11.
